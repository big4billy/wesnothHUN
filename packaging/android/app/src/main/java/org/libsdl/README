The java source code files in this folder (under org/libsdl) are copied here from https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/tree/SDL2/android-project/app/src/main/java/org/libsdl/app as per SDL Android packaging guidelines, with some HID parts disabled via commit f85e536de2bb97081d705cb155a7caebf17cd8e1 that cause crashes on Android. They act as wrappers around a SDL C++ project (such as Wesnoth) that allow it to be launched as an Android Activity. Should be periodically updated if needed from SDL upstream repo.
